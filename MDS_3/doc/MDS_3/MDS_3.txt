\section MDS_3_section_intro Introduction

This package is devoted to the representation of 3-Dimensional Mesh Data Structures.
The domain to be meshed is a subset of 3D space, required to be bounded.


\subsection MDS_3ImplementationHistory Implementation History

The code of the package `MDS_3` was initially part of the package `Mesh_3`.
With the meshing processes becoming more versatile, it was moved to its own package in the
release 5.4 of \cgal.
