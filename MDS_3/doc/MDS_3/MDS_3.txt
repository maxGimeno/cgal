\section MDS_3_section_intro Introduction

This package is devoted to the representation of 3-Dimensional Mesh Data Structures.
The domain to be meshed is a subset of 3D space, required to be bounded.


//The template parameter `C3T3` is required to be a model of
//the concept
//`MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3`, a data structure devised to
//represent a three dimensional complex embedded in a 3D
//triangulation. In both functions, an instance of type `C3T3` is used to maintain the current
//approximating simplicial mesh
//and to represent the final 3D mesh at the end
//of the procedure.
//
//The embedding 3D triangulation is required to be the nested type
//`CGAL::Mesh_triangulation_3::type`, provided by the class template
//`CGAL::Mesh_triangulation_3`. The type for this triangulation is a
//wrapper around the class `CGAL::Regular_triangulation_3` whose vertex and cell base classes
//are respectively models of the concepts `MeshVertexBase_3` and
//`MeshCellBase_3`.

\subsection MDS_3ImplementationHistory Implementation History

The code of the package `MDS_3` was initially part of the package `Mesh_3`.
With the meshing processes becoming more versatile, it was moved to its own package in the
release 5.4 of \cgal.
