\section MDS_3_section_intro Introduction

This package is devoted to the representation of 3-Dimensional Mesh Data Structures.

A 3D mesh is a discretization of a given bounded subset of the 3D space,
that holds all geometric and combinatorial data to construct a valid
and consistent discretization.
In this chapter, we describe higher-level data structures available
for the description of such meshes.

\section MDS_3_section_c3t3

CGAL provides 3D triangulations, that are described by
both their geometry and connectivity, using the
the `3D Triangulation` and `3D Triangulation  Data Structure` packages.

We introduce the concept of "mesh complex", that encodes extra information
on top of a 3D triangulation.


`MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3`, a data structure devised to
//represent a three dimensional complex embedded in a 3D
//triangulation. In both functions, an instance of type `C3T3` is used to maintain the current
//approximating simplicial mesh
//and to represent the final 3D mesh at the end
//of the procedure.
//
//The embedding 3D triangulation is required to be the nested type
//`CGAL::Mesh_triangulation_3::type`, provided by the class template
//`CGAL::Mesh_triangulation_3`. The type for this triangulation is a
//wrapper around the class `CGAL::Regular_triangulation_3` whose vertex and cell base classes
//are respectively models of the concepts `MeshVertexBase_3` and
//`MeshCellBase_3`.

\subsection MDS_3ImplementationHistory Implementation History

The code of the package `MDS_3` was initially part of the package `Mesh_3`.
With the meshing processes becoming more versatile, it was moved to its own package in the
release 5.4 of \cgal.
